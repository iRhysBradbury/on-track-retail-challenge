Describe 2 different ways of versioning REST API endpoints. Which is your preferred method and why.

REST API Versioning strategies

- URL versioning

This is when your route contains a version number. This is an industry preferred method.
eg:

localhost:8080/api/v1/my-route

Why?
Fits REST principles; denotation in the resource, although arguably a miss match of concern when describing the underlying entity.
Industry standard; I've seen this method across multiple API's.
Clear indication of API version to consumer.


- HTTP Header

This is when you have a HTTP Header on your HTTP Request
eg:

version: v1

Why?
Fits rest principles. Although headers are supposed to describe the resource. This is a cross concern.
Would you 404 if version is not included? is it really a 404?.. as you cant 'fall back' onto a default api version. That's just madness.


In conclusion, my preferred version would be the URL versioning method. This is because of the transparency when consuming the service.
I have personally used this method as well as other methods (mentioned and not mentioned) and this method provides 'best' transparency.
